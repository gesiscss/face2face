## Short summary

With the methods from the import module you can import your own tij- and metadata data sets or you can use predefined data sets which are included in the installed library. With the Data Object you created with your or the predefined data sets you can directly start with the analysis of the probability for different contact durations and visualize them. You can also use the Object to create a network and analyze this network in terms of basic key figures about the underlying network. Furthermore you can use this library to analyze and visualize the homophily of the given data set.
